Measuring an Organization's Impact through Network Connections

This is a copy of the data analtics code for the ASU Unit for Data Science and Analytics' Neptune project, 
but with a created test set of data in order to maintain the protected information of the actual personnel involved. 

"create.py"  will be a file instantiating the data, 

"analysis.py" will be the data analysis

"random.py" will be the creation of constrained random graphs and performing the same analysis as the data analysis for comparison
